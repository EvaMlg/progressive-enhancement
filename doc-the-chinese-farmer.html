   <h2 class="story"> The story </h2>

<p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, </p> <blockquote class="farmers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote><p>The farmer said, </p><blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe."</blockquote><p> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p><blockquote class="farmers"><p>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</blockquote><p>The farmer again said,</p><blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote> 

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p><blockquote class="farmers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</blockquote><p>and the farmer responded,</p><blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote><p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p><blockquote class="farmers">“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote><p>Again, he said, </p><blockquote class="far">“Maybe.”</blockquote>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

   Conclusion

   Good and bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
